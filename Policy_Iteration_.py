#Policy Iteration
#Considering the following Markov Decision Process:
#State-space --> 10Ã—10 grid
#The robot gets a reward of 10 if it reaches the desired terminal state with a discount factor of 0.9.
#At each non-obstacle cell, the robot can attempt to move to any of the immediate neighboring cells using one of the four controls (North, East, West and South). The robot cannot diagonally. 
#The move succeeds with probability 0.7 and with remainder probability 0.3 the robot can end up at some other cell as follows:
#P(moves north | control is north) = 0.7,
#P(moves west | control is north) = 0.1,
#P(moves east | control is north) = 0.1,
#P(moves south | control is north) = 0,
#P(does not move | control is north) = 0.1.
#At boundaries assuming there is equal probability to move along the feasible states 
# --> 3 possibilities with 0.33 at corners and 2 possibilities with 0.5 at edge states.

#Policy iteration to find the best trajectory for the robot to go from the start to the goal.
